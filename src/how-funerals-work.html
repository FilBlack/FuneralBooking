                                    support during the grieving process. Funeral homes typically have viewing rooms,

                            ashes, which are then given to the family. Cremation is a flexible option that can be
                            more affordable than traditional burials, and the ashes can be kept, buried, or
                            scattered in a meaningful location</div>

                            This process often includes a graveside service where family and friends gather to say their
                            final goodbyes. Burial plots are purchased, and fees for opening and closing the grave are
                            typically involved.</div>

                            either in advance or at the time of need. This includes paying for the plot and any
                            associated fees for opening and closing the grave. The cemetery staff coordinates with the
                            funeral director to ensure the burial process is smooth and respectful.</div>

                            take several months. Families first choose a design and inscription, often working with a
                            stonemason. Once approved, the tombstone is crafted, which can take some time. After
                            completion, the tombstone is installed at the gravesite, marking the final resting place of
                            the deceased.</div>

                            setting. Wakes can be held at home or in a funeral home and are an important tradition in
